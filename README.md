This is the code for the Hybrid Plasticity project. Here are some general notes:

The code in the Biological Studies was developed almost solely by me, this is where the large majority of important findings in this project
stemmed from. 

The code in the RL studies is adapted from the github repo. https://github.com/enajx/HebbianMetaLearning. This was done to allow me to compare my algorithim directly against theirs. Throughout the project, I reached out to them a couple times with questions about their original paper and to get help with using the repo.
