# Hybrid Plasticity

This is the code for the Hybrid Plasticity project. Here are some general notes:

The code in the Biological Studies was developed almost solely by me, this is where the large majority of important findings in this project
stemmed from. 

The code in the RL studies is adapted from the github repo. https://github.com/enajx/HebbianMetaLearning

This was done to allow me to compare my algorithim directly against theirs. Throughout the project, I reached out to them 
a couple times with questions about their original paper and to get help with using the repo. In my paper, the results of using 
that repo and comparisons against their algorithim are considered in page 9. 

Currently, the code in the Biological Studies folder is messy, mainly because during the development process I tried our many different possible
implementations of various networks and tests. I am planning on open-sourcing this project and the developed codes once I finish cleaning them, 
this will be found in the following github repo, https://github.com/rkalahasty/Hybrid-Plasticity.
